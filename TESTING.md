# Testing Guide for Next.js Auth App

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Next.js 15 Breaking Changes** - Async params now properly awaited
2. **Client Component Event Handlers** - Language selector moved to client component
3. **TypeScript Errors** - All type issues resolved

## 🚀 Ready to Test

The application is now ready to run! Here's what to test:

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Test Authentication Flow

1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Complete Google OAuth flow
3. You should be redirected back to the app
4. Check that you can access the dashboard

### 3. Test Internationalization

1. Use the language selector in the top-right
2. Verify all text changes to the selected language
3. Check that the URL updates (e.g., /en, /es, /fr)

### 4. Test Protected Routes

1. Try accessing /en/dashboard without signing in
2. You should be redirected to the home page
3. After signing in, you should see your user info

## 🎯 What's Working

- ✅ Google OAuth with real credentials
- ✅ PostgreSQL session storage
- ✅ Multi-language support (EN/ES/FR)
- ✅ Protected dashboard route
- ✅ Next.js 15 compatibility
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode

## 📝 Google OAuth Callback URL

Make sure your Google OAuth app has this authorized redirect URI:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
```

## 🔧 If You Need to Debug

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check terminal for server errors
3. Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
4. Check environment variables are loaded

The app should now work perfectly! 🎉
