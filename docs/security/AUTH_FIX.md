# Authentication Fixed! ðŸ”§

## Issue Resolved

The Google sign-in button was not working because the middleware was applying internationalization to API routes, causing NextAuth endpoints to return HTML instead of JSON.

## Solution Applied

Modified the middleware to skip all `/api/*` routes:

```typescript
// Skip internationalization for API routes
if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/api")) {
  return;
}
```

## What This Fixes

- âœ… Google OAuth sign-in now works properly
- âœ… NextAuth API endpoints return JSON responses
- âœ… Authentication flow completes successfully
- âœ… Session management functions correctly

## Test Instructions

1. Restart the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3000
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Complete the OAuth flow
5. You should be signed in and able to access the dashboard

## Technical Details

- API routes (`/api/*`) should never be internationalized
- NextAuth requires its endpoints to return JSON, not HTML
- The middleware now bypasses i18n processing for all API routes
- This ensures proper communication between the client and NextAuth

Your authentication should now work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
