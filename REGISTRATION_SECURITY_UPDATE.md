# Registration Security Update

## What Was Missing
After implementing login security, we discovered the registration forms were missing similar protections:
- No email normalization (could register USER@EXAMPLE.COM and user@example.com as different accounts)
- No password complexity requirements
- No max length validation

## What We Added

### 1. Email Normalization ✅
```typescript
email: z.string()
  .email("Invalid email address")
  .max(254, "Email too long")
  .transform(email => email.trim().toLowerCase())
```
- Trims whitespace
- Converts to lowercase
- Ensures consistent email format

### 2. Password Complexity Requirements ✅
```typescript
password: z.string()
  .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters long")
  .max(128, "Password too long")
  .regex(/[A-Z]/, "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter")
  .regex(/[a-z]/, "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter")
  .regex(/[0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one number")
  .regex(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one special character")
```

Requirements:
- 8-128 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter  
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### 3. Applied to All Password Forms ✅
- Registration
- Add password (for Google users)
- Change password

## Benefits
1. **Prevents duplicate accounts** with different email casing
2. **Enforces strong passwords** across all forms
3. **Consistent validation** between login and registration
4. **Better user experience** with clear requirements

## User Impact
Users will see helpful error messages:
- "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"
- "Password must contain at least one number"
- "Email too long"
- etc.

## Testing the Changes
```bash
# Test registration with:
- Email: "  USER@EXAMPLE.COM  " → stored as "user@example.com"
- Weak password: "password" → rejected
- Strong password: "Password123!" → accepted
```

## About the Logging Suggestion

Your suggestion about security logging is excellent:
```typescript
// Instead of mixing with console.warn:
logger.security('rate-limit-exceeded', { 
  email: email.substring(0, 3) + '***',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

This would require setting up a proper logging system (Winston, Pino, etc.). For now, `console.warn` works, but this is a great future improvement for production!
