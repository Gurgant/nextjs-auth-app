# Critical Conversation Backup - Credentials Authentication Implementation

## Summary of Lost Work
We successfully implemented a complete credentials authentication system that was destroyed by another AI's git reset --hard command. This document serves as a backup reference for reconstruction.

## What We Built Together

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added password field to User model in Prisma schema (nullable for OAuth users)
- Made email field required for all users

### 2. Dependencies Added
- bcryptjs (for password hashing)
- @types/bcryptjs
- tsx (for running TypeScript scripts)

### 3. Auth Configuration
- Added Credentials provider to NextAuth
- Implemented JWT strategy (changed from database strategy)
- Added JWT and session callbacks for mixed authentication

### 4. Components Created
- `/src/components/auth/credentials-form.tsx` - Email/password login form
- Updated home page to toggle between OAuth and credentials
- Fixed hydration errors with suppressHydrationWarning

### 5. User Creation Script
- `/scripts/create-user.ts` - Script to create test users with hashed passwords
- Test user: test@example.com / password123

### 6. Fixes Applied
- Changed session strategy from "database" to "jwt" for credentials compatibility
- Fixed locale-aware redirects
- Added suppressHydrationWarning to fix browser extension issues
- Updated middleware to exclude API routes from i18n

### 7. Documentation Created
- CREDENTIALS_AUTH.md
- CREDENTIALS_FIX_COMPLETE.md
- MIXED_AUTH_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- CREDENTIALS_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- CREDENTIALS_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md

## Critical Code Snippets from Our Implementation

### Prisma Schema Update
```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String    @unique  // Required for all users
  emailVerified DateTime?
  password      String?   // For credentials auth
  image         String?
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  accounts Account[]
  sessions Session[]
  
  @@index([email])
}
```

### Auth.ts Configuration
```typescript
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"
import Credentials from "next-auth/providers/credentials"
import { PrismaAdapter } from "@auth/prisma-adapter"
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs"

// Added Credentials provider with bcrypt password verification
// Changed session strategy to "jwt"
// Added jwt and session callbacks
```

### Test Results
The system was working perfectly:
- ✅ Credentials login successful
- ✅ Google OAuth still working
- ✅ Multi-language support functioning
- ✅ Protected routes accessible
- ✅ Sign out working
- ✅ No console errors

## Recovery Status
Currently on branch: backup-credentials-work
All work lost due to git reset --hard by another AI
